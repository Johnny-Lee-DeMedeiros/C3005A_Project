# C3005A_Project
Final Project for C3005A Database Class

Name: Johnny Lee-De Medeiros

- C3005A_Project_Report details the designing process for the bookstore database
- DDL files will be used to import the database table schemas by executing \i "url_to_ddl_file" in the SQL shell after creating a new database

How to Add tables:
1. Open SQL shell
2. Log into the default database
3. Enter: create database bookstore;
4. Re-open the SQL shell
5. Log into the bookstore database
6. Enter \i 'url-to-Project_DDL.sql' (make sure to replace the \'s to /'s in the url)
7. Done, open pg4admin to inspect the tables further
